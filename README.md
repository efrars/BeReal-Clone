 # Project 5 - BeReal Clone Part II

**About the App:**
BeReal Clone is an app that is similar to photo social media applications. In this second part of BeReal, the user will have the ability to use their camera from an iOS device, take a picture, crop it, add a caption and then post it into their feed. In addition, a user who signs up will not be able to user other's user posts until they post a picture. Other user pictures will be blurred, when the picture is posten, then other user's pictures will be revealed. In addition, if user switches app, the application will not log out user profile. 

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [*] User can launch camera to take photo instead of photo library
- [*] User session persists when application is closed and relaunched

- [*] Users are able to log out and return to sign in page
- [*] Users are NOT able to see other photos until they upload their own

## Notes
**Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.**
 One of the challenges that I faced while building the application was adding the blur effect after having all the auto layout constraints from the first part of the project. In addition, since I own an iOS device, I had to researched how to set up my device to be the simulator for Xcode.
